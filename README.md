# Simple React Start

Very simple react starter project including React, Webpack and React Hot Loader.

## Usage:

* `yarn install` to install all dependencies
* `yarn start`: start development server (http://localhost:8080) with enabled hot module replacement
* `yarn dist`: create a distribution js file (`public/dist` folder)

## From within Visual Studio Code:

* Run Task `Run DevServer` to start dev server (same as `yarn start` from command line, just for your convience)
* Debug with `Debug with CHROME` to debug your application from Visual Studio Code in Chrome (`Debugger for Chrome` extension required)
